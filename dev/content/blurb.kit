        <p>By traveling to new places we can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us. When we go to a new place all of our senses and instincts become awake. In such circumstances, we can learn new things very easily. Everything seems beautiful and sterling in a new place. </p>
